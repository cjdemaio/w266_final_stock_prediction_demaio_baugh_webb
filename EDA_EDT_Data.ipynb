The capital will also be used to support the inorganic growth efforts of its partner firms . Carson has made nine minority investments in advisory firms to date , some of which were existing partners and some of which joined concurrent with the investment . Mike Kabarec , founder of his eponymously named RIA based in Palatine , IL , stated , \\\"I told Ron Carson when I went to visit them in Omaha that I wish I had found them 10 years earlier . The access to leading-edge resources and technology for my clients , combined with their expertise in succession planning and M&A , allowed me to transition the bulk of my equity down to my younger partners while also positioning us for growth well into the future.\\\" Mr . Kabarec's firm , now a Carson Wealth-branded office , sold a minority stake to Carson at the beginning of 2019 . Since then , they have brought on two advisors and have grown their assets by 75 percent . Aaron Schaben , President of Carson Group , said he sees business owners he talks to increasingly ready to engage in buy/build/partner decisions , especially given the events of the last few months . \\\"Historically , advisors under $600M or so in assets under management have had two choices when it comes to liquidity events and/or succession planning: figure it out on their own , or sell to a larger player , which of course means giving up their independence , control and entrepreneurialism . We are addressing this gap by providing minority investments in firms to help with succession planning and equity transfers , and by supporting their growth efforts through Carson's value-added resourcesall while they maintain majority control and ownership of their business.\\\" Carson Partner firms , irrespective of whether they take a minority investment from Carson , gain access to the latest technology , investment strategies , full-scale marketing resources , compliance expertise , succession planning and the proven game plan for growth that is fueling the nation's fastest growing firms . Carson also currently has a team of six dedicated M&A stakeholders who support partners in identifying acquisition opportunities , negotiating terms and ultimately , onboarding new individuals and teams into their business and the Carson ecosystem . The capital will be used to supplement the existing financing sources of their partners . Carson's Managing Director of Mergers and Acquisitions Jason Carver added , \\\"We are in the process of completing our tenth minority investment and we have a number of opportunities behind it . The need is there ,\",\n          \"Toptal Sees Applications Surge over 50% as COVID-19 Disruption Accelerates Shift to Remote Working Record Number of Applications to Join Global Leader in On-demand Talent Network NEW YORK , Oct . 19 , 2020 / / Toptal , an elite network of the world's top talent in business , design , and technology that enables companies to scale their teams on demand , has seen applications to join its global talent network increase by 55% in the first nine months of 2020 compared to the same period last year , as the COVID-19 disruption drives record numbers of people to consider switching to remote freelance work . The company , set up as fully remote at its foundation 10 years ago , is seeing growing demand across multiple industry sectors , including automotive , logistics , and fast-moving consumer goods , as clients seek out the best available global expertise to work alongside their permanent employees . Record Number of Applications to Join Global Leader in On-Demand Talent Network Tweet this Taso Du Val , Toptal chief executive officer , said: \\\"The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated a paradigm shift in the employment marketplace as more and more companies have changed the way they access the world's best talent . This is coinciding with a surge in applications that we are seeing from specialists in multiple industries who after months of remote working are deciding to take ownership of their career paths and value in the labor market.\\\" In the first nine months of the year , Toptal has seen the volume of applicants to join its specialist , on-demand talent network increase by 55% tomore than200,000 people . Business-client demand , based on the volume of roles required , has also risen through 2020 , including rises of over 20% in North America , Asia-Pacific , and across the European Union . In the UK , demand is up by 40% compared to 2019 . Fewer than 3% of applicants to Toptal's network are accepted . To date , the company hasmore than10,000 professionals in its network , all of whom have been through the same rigorous test and vetting process that is the hallmark of the Toptal offer to its clients.\\\"Many parts of the staffing and outsourcing sectors , which have traditionally focused on high-volume , low-cost labor , are not configured to adjust to the new realities of what the world's biggest companies need,\\\" added Du Val . \\\"What we are seeing is companies seeking out specialist , on-demand talent to solve particular industry challenges in ways that deliver lasting , high-value solutions . This specialist segment is set to be one of the fastest-growing parts of the talent economy this year and beyond.\\\"Toptal provides access to experts in areas such as software engineering , finance , project management , product management , and design.Despite the impact of the pandemic , Toptal is set again for a successive year of profitable hypergrowth ( over 40% revenue growth ) . The company is forecasting full-year gross revenues in excess of $300\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"1\",\n
